In this basic exercise I wanted to put into practice some of what I understood with JPA annotations in this case using springboot as framework. 

My purpose was to understand the use of annotations like @entity which allows me to mark my TestRepo class as an entity and at the same time associate it to a database structure; 
also @table which allows me to create my table inside my database; at the same time annotations like Id to create my primary keys and @generatedvalue to manage how those keys will be initialized; 
finally @column with which I can easily create the columns inside my tables. 

In so few lines of code I can notice the difference between starting a project created manually using JDBC and JPA and the ease and convenience that Springboot provides as frameworks along with dependencies. 

This way I can also have a better understanding of how it works, possible uses and other configurations such as creating and connecting databases.  
In these practices I will be deepening my knowledge about Java as a programming language and springboot as framewoks. 
In this simple exercise I was able to solve errors about how to connect to my database; understand the run method and the 
way in which the app is started; if it is directly with SpringApplication or also saving the app in a context where with other popositos can make modifications of that context.
